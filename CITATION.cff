title: 'Pyunicorn: Unified Complex Network and Recurrence Analysis Toolbox'
abstract: pyunicorn (Unified Complex Network and RecurreNce analysis toolbox) is an
  object-oriented Python package for the advanced analysis and modeling of complex networks.
  Beyond the standard measures of complex network theory (such as degree, betweenness and
  clustering coefficients), it provides some uncommon but interesting statistics like
  Newman's random walk betweenness. pyunicorn also provides novel node-weighted (node
  splitting invariant) network statistics, measures for analyzing networks of
  interacting/interdependent networks, and special tools to model spatially embedded complex
  networks.

  Moreover, pyunicorn allows one to easily construct networks from uni- and multivariate
  time series and event data (functional/climate networks and recurrence networks). This
  involves linear and nonlinear measures of time series analysis for constructing functional
  networks from multivariate data (e.g., Pearson correlation, mutual information, event
  synchronization and event coincidence analysis). pyunicorn also features modern techniques
  of nonlinear analysis of time series (or pairs thereof), such as recurrence quantification
  analysis (RQA), recurrence network analysis and visibility graphs.

  pyunicorn is fast, because all costly computations are performed in compiled C code. It can
  handle large networks through the use of sparse data structures. The package can be used
  interactively, from any Python script, and even for parallel computations on large cluster
  architectures.

  abstract: We introduce the pyunicorn (Pythonic unified complex network and recurrence analysis
    toolbox) open source software package for applying and combining modern methods of data
    analysis and modeling from complex network theory and nonlinear time series analysis. pyunicorn
    is a fully object-oriented and easily parallelizable package written in the language Python. It
    allows for the construction of functional networks such as climate networks in climatology or
    functional brain networks in neuroscience representing the structure of statistical
    interrelationships in large data sets of time series and, subsequently, investigating this
    structure using advanced methods of complex network theory such as measures and models for
    spatial networks, networks of interacting networks, node-weighted statistics, or network
    surrogates. Additionally, pyunicorn provides insights into the nonlinear dynamics of complex
    systems as recorded in uni- and multivariate time series from a non-traditional perspective by
    means of recurrence quantification analysis, recurrence networks, visibility graphs, and
    construction of surrogate time series. The range of possible applications of the library is
    outlined, drawing on several examples mainly from the field of climatology.
