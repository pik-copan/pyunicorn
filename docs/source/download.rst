Platforms and Compatibility
---------------------------
``pyunicorn`` is written in Python 2.7. The software is quite flexible, we have
it running on Linux and MacOSX machines, the institute's IBM iDataPlex cluster
and even on Windows.

    :end-before: Installing

Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, igraph and other packages should be available via a
package management system on Linux or MacOSX. All packages can be downloaded,
compiled and installed following the instructions on their homepages.

An easy way to go may be a Python distribution like `Anaconda
<https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_ or `Enthought
<http://www.enthought.com>`_ that already include many libraries.
